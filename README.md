## Description

This Prework Study Guide Webpage serves to provide a repository of information for reference throughout the bootcamp process. This information can be updated throughout the bootcamp process and be retained for future development and use as I become more experienced with full-stack web development processes.

## Usage

Each section of the Prework Study Guide contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. And if we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
